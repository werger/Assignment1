The assignment was to develop building blocks for different geo-political regions.  The class hierchy starts at region, an abstract class, then branches to container region and atomic region.   From container region, country and state branch off of it and from atomic region, city branches off of it.  Each class extends from another class sharing attributes and variables.  The driver function creates the objects and will display the results after they are created.
